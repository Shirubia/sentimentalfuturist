<h2>Colophon</h2>
<h3>Site history</h3>
<p>
    <em>Sentimental futurist</em>
    was created around August 2023, but I started tracking the changes in GitHub in October of that year. This is the second
    version of the site, and was launched on
    <time datetime="2025-04-23" title="23/04/2025 (DD/MM/YYYY)">
        <strong>23/04/2025</strong></time>.
    <p>
        Previously this website was
        <em>shirubia.net</em>; I'm fond of that name, but kinda got tired of it as it was too personal, too
            me.
        <em>Sentimental futurist</em>
        is a title that still speaks about the person, but it's a rather indistinct identity that makes me feel more confortable
        (if that makes sense).
