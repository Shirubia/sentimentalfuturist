    Name's
    <mark>Silvia</mark>
    <sup>(she/they)</sup>. Front-end developer by day, fanfiction reader by night. Or something. I go by many other names: I
        used to be known as Shirubia and you can call me Sil, Shiru, Senti or whatever.

    Ever since I was eight, I wanted a computer of my own; it took another eight years for my wish to come true. In 2002 I
    created my first website in Geocities with a WYSIWYG editor (with starry background and all), and since then I've
    inhabited the internets with various blogs and small personal projects.

    Now I do for a living the same things I do for fun: stare at a computer screen for hours on end and perpetrate code.
    Which probably means I'm not right in the head. But at least my coding skills are better now... Slightly â˜º
