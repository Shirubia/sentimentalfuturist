<h3>Work & life</h3>
<p>Living in Castell√≥n (it's been a year now!) with husbando‚ô°. Still working as a software engineer, mostly focused on
    front-end development.</p>
<h3>Reading</h3>
<p>
    <a href="https://app.thestorygraph.com/currently-reading/shirubia" rel="external">Something, hopefully</a>
    (I really need to create a /reading page that fetches data from The Storygraph).</p>
<h3>Watching</h3>
<p>I'm watching a lot of anime these days, among other things:</p>
<ul>
    <li>The Witcher</li>
    <li>The Apothecary Diaries</li>
    <li>Somali and the Forest Spirit</li>
    <li>Ranking of Kings</li>
    <li>cozy YouTube channels (my guilty pleasure)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Playing</h3>
<p>I'm having fun playing
    <em>Pok√©mon Trading Card Game Pocket</em>
    with friends, and collecting pretty cards. I'm also playing
    <em>Ring Fit Adventure</em>
    to try and get some exercise into my schedule.
</p>
<h3>Learning</h3>
<p>Knitting üß∂ (I'm taking my time, <small>I will finish that scarf someday</small>). Tech-related: Springboot and RxJS (slowly also :) ).</p>
